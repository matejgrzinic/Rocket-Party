# Rocket Party
 
This is a source code of 3D video game I created as my final assignment in class Computer Graphics. Game is written in C++ and OpenGL. Dependencies that I used are GLFW and GLEW. 

Game is played by two players and is turn based. Each player has 3 lives. 

Project could be greatly improved by using models, but I focused mainly on the logic of the game.

Some examples:
